Welcome to my page! This is Tianzhong Lan, a second-year doctoral student in the [College of Computer Science](https://cs.scu.edu.cn/), [Sichuan University](https://www.scu.edu.cn/), under the supervision of Prof. [Min Zhu](https://cs.scu.edu.cn/info/1279/13673.htm). And I received a master's degree from Sichuan University in 2022, under the supervision of Prof. [Zhang Yi](https://cs.scu.edu.cn/info/1288/13625.htm).  
<!-- Here is my [CV](https://echochou990919.github.io/files/YiZhou_CV.pdf). -->

My research interests include Machine Learning and Computer Vision, especially Domain Adaptation and Explainable AI in pulmonary nodule detection. I am currently very interested in the study of the Universal Pulmonary Nodule Detector that can be learned from Limited Resources in terms of both Data and Computing Capability, welcome to exchange advice!

Hobbies
======
In daily life, I enjoy sports including fitness, swimming, and badminton; I love symphonic and pop music. When I have sufficient time, traveling afar to discover beautiful scenery is my favorite thing - embracing the saying "read ten thousand books, travel ten thousand miles".
