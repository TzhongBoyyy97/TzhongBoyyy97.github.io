Welcome to my page! This is Tianzhong Lan, a third-year doctoral student in the [College of Computer Science](https://cs.scu.edu.cn/), [Sichuan University](https://www.scu.edu.cn/), under the supervision of Prof. [Min Zhu](https://cs.scu.edu.cn/info/1279/13673.htm). And I received a master's degree from Sichuan University in 2022, under the supervision of Prof. [Zhang Yi](https://cs.scu.edu.cn/info/1288/13625.htm).  
<!-- Here is my [CV](https://echochou990919.github.io/files/YiZhou_CV.pdf). -->

My research interests include **Computer Vision** and **Medical Imaging Processing**, especially Label-efficient Learning for Cross-domain Tumor Diagnosis. I am currently interested in building a unified framework for lesion detection and segmentation and then improving its generalizability under various data distributions; welcome to exchange advice!

Hobbies
======
In daily life, I enjoy sports, including fitness, swimming, and badminton; I love symphonic and pop music. When I have sufficient time, traveling afar to discover beautiful scenery is my favorite thing - embracing the saying "read ten thousand books, travel ten thousand miles."
