Welcome to my page! This is Tianzhong Lan, a third-year Ph.D. candidate in the [College of Computer Science](https://cs.scu.edu.cn/), [Sichuan University](https://www.scu.edu.cn/), under the supervision of Prof. [Zhang Yi](http://www.machineilab.org/users/zhangyi/index.html) and Prof. [Min Zhu](http://scuvis.org). I have been awarded the Chinese CSC scholarship to pursue research at the A*STAR in Singapore from July 2025 to July 2026, under the supervision of Principal Scientists [Xulei Yang](https://dawdleryang.github.io) and [Feng Yang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=i-UD9l4AAAAJ&hl=zh-CN&oi=ao).
<!-- Here is my [CV](https://echochou990919.github.io/files/YiZhou_CV.pdf). -->

My research interests include **Computer Vision** and **Medical Image Analysis**, particularly **Label-efficient Learning** for **Cross-Domain Tumor Diagnosis**. I am interested in developing a unified framework for tumor detection and segmentation to enhance its generalizability across diverse data distributions. Welcome to exchange advice!

Hobbies
======
Daily, I enjoy sports, including fitness, swimming, and badminton; I love symphonic and pop music. When I have sufficient time, traveling afar to discover beautiful scenery is my favorite thing - embracing the saying "read ten thousand books, travel ten thousand miles."
